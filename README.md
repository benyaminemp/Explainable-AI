# ðŸ§  Explainable-AI (XAI)

Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques used to make AI systems' decision-making processes understandable and transparent to humans. Essentially, XAI aims to shed light on how AI models arrive at their conclusions, fostering trust and facilitating human oversight. This repository demonstrates how to apply model-agnostic explainability techniques â€” **SHAP** and **LIME** â€” to understand predictions made by machine learning models
